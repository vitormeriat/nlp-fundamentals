    "# Chapter 4. Feed-Forward Networks for Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 3, we covered the foundations of neural networks by looking at the perceptron, the simplest neural network that can exist. One of the historic downfalls of the perceptron was that it cannot learn modestly nontrivial patterns present in data. For example, take a look at the plotted data points in Figure 4-1. This is equivalent to an either-or (XOR) situation in which the decision boundary cannot be a single straight line (otherwise known as being linearly separable). In this case, the perceptron fails.\n",

    "In this chapter, we explore a family of neural network models traditionally called feed-forward networks. We focus on two kinds of feed-forward neural networks: the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the convolutional neural network (CNN).1 The multilayer perceptron structurally extends the simpler perceptron we studied in Chapter 3 by grouping many perceptrons in a single layer and stacking multiple layers together. We cover multilayer perceptrons in just a moment and show their use in multiclass classification in “Example: Surname Classification with an MLP”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second kind of feed-forward neural networks studied in this chapter, the convolutional neural network, is deeply inspired by windowed filters in the processing of digital signals. Through this windowing property, CNNs are able to learn localized patterns in their inputs, which has not only made them the workhorse of computer vision but also an ideal candidate for detecting substructures in sequential data, such as words and sentences. We explore CNNs in “Convolutional Neural Networks” and demonstrate their use in “Example: Classifying Surnames by Using a CNN”.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, MLPs and CNNs are grouped together because they are both feed-forward neural networks and stand in contrast to a different family of neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which allow for feedback (or cycles) such that each computation is informed by the previous computation. In Figures 6 and 7, we cover RNNs and why it can be beneficial to allow cycles in the network structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we walk through these different models, one useful way to make sure you understand how things work is to pay attention to the size and shape of the data tensors as they are being computed. Each type of neural network layer has a specific effect on the size and shape of the data tensor it is computing on, and understanding that effect can be extremely conducive to a deeper understanding of these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Multilayer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "The multilayer perceptron is considered one of the most basic neural network building blocks. The simplest MLP is an extension to the perceptron of Chapter 3. The perceptron takes the data vector2 as input and computes a single output value. In an MLP, many perceptrons are grouped so that the output of a single layer is a new vector instead of a single output value. In PyTorch, as you will see later, this is done simply by setting the number of output features in the Linear layer. An additional aspect of an MLP is that it combines multiple layers with a nonlinearity in between each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest MLP, displayed in Figure 4-2, is composed of three stages of representation and two Linear layers. The first stage is the input vector. This is the vector that is given to the model. In “Example: Classifying Sentiment of Restaurant Reviews”, the input vector was a collapsed one-hot representation of a Yelp review. Given the input vector, the first Linear layer computes a hidden vector—the second stage of representation. The hidden vector is called such because it is the output of a layer that’s between the input and the output. What do we mean by “output of a layer”? One way to understand this is that the values in the hidden vector are the output of different perceptrons that make up that layer. Using this hidden vector, the second Linear layer computes an output vector. In a binary task like classifying the sentiment of Yelp reviews, the output vector could still be of size 1. In a multiclass setting, as you’ll see in “Example: Surname Classification with an MLP”, the size of the output vector is equal to the number of classes. Although in this illustration we show only one hidden vector, it is possible to have multiple intermediate stages, each producing its own hidden vector. Always, the final hidden vector is mapped to the output vector using a combination of Linear layer and a nonlinearity.\n",

    "\n",
    "The power of MLPs comes from adding the second Linear layer and allowing the model to learn an intermediate representation that is linearly separable—a property of representations in which a single straight line (or more generally, a hyperplane) can be used to distinguish the data points by which side of the line (or hyperplane) they fall on. Learning intermediate representations that have specific properties, like being linearly separable for a classification task, is one of the most profound consequences of using neural networks and is quintessential to their modeling capabilities. In the next section, we take a much closer, in-depth look at what that means."

    "### A Simple Example: XOR\n",

    "Let’s take a look at the XOR example described earlier and see what would happen with a perceptron versus an MLP. In this example, we train both the perceptron and an MLP in a binary classification task: identifying stars and circles. Each data point is a 2D coordinate. Without diving into the implementation details yet, the final model predictions are shown in Figure 4-3. In this plot, incorrectly classified data points are filled in with black, whereas correctly classified data points are not filled in. In the left panel, you can see that the perceptron has difficulty in learning a decision boundary that can separate the stars and circles, as evidenced by the filled in shapes. However, the MLP (right panel) learns a decision boundary that classifies the stars and circles much more accurately.\n",

In Figure 4-4, we can see the intermediate values being computed by the MLP. The shapes of the points indicate the class (star or circle). What we see is that the neural network (an MLP in this case) has learned to “warp” the space in which the data lives so that it can divide the dataset with a single line by the time it passes through the final layer.\n",

    "### Implementing MLPs in PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we outlined the core ideas of the MLP. In this section, we walk through an implementation in PyTorch. As described, the MLP has an additional layer of computation beyond the simpler perceptron we saw in Chapter 3. In the implementation that we present in Example 4-1, we instantiate this idea with two of PyTorch’s Linear modules. The Linear objects are named fc1 and fc2, following a common convention that refers to a Linear module as a “fully connected layer,” or “fc layer” for short.3 In addition to these two Linear layers, there is a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity (introduced in Chapter 3, in “Activation Functions”) which is applied to the output of the first Linear layer before it is provided as input to the second Linear layer. Because of the sequential nature of the layers, you must take care to ensure that the number of outputs in a layer is equal to the number of inputs to the next layer. Using a nonlinearity between two Linear layers is essential because without it, two Linear layers in sequence are mathematically equivalent to a single Linear layer4 and thus unable to model complex patterns. Our implementation of the MLP implements only the forward pass of the backpropagation. This is because PyTorch automatically figures out how to do the backward pass and gradient updates based on the definition of the model and the implementation of the forward pass."

    "It is important to learn how to read inputs and outputs of PyTorch models. In the preceding example, the output of the MLP model is a tensor that has two rows and four columns. The rows in this tensor correspond to the batch dimension, which is the number of data points in the minibatch. The columns are the final feature vectors for each data point.5 In some cases, such as in a classification setting, the feature vector is a prediction vector. The name “prediction vector” means that it corresponds to a probability distribution. What happens with the prediction vector depends on whether we are currently conducting training or performing inference. During training, the outputs are used as is with a loss function and a representation of the target class labels.6 We cover this in depth in “Example: Surname Classification with an MLP”.\n",

Specifically, you require the softmax activation function, which is used to transform a vector of values into probabilities. The softmax function has many roots. In physics, it is known as the Boltzmann or Gibbs distribution; in statistics, it’s multinomial logistic regression; and in the natural language processing (NLP) community it’s known as the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) classifier.7 Whatever the name, the intuition underlying the function is that large positive values will result in higher probabilities, and lower negative values will result in smaller probabilities.

    "## Example: Surname Classification with an MLP\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we apply the MLP to the task of classifying surnames to their country of origin. Inferring demographic information (like nationality) from publicly observable data has applications from product recommendations to ensuring fair outcomes for users across different demographics. However, demographic and other self-identifying attributes are collectively called “protected attributes.” You must exercise care in the use of such attributes in modeling and in products.9 We begin by splitting the characters of each surname and treating them the same way we treated words in “Example: Classifying Sentiment of Restaurant Reviews”. Aside from the data difference, character-level models are mostly similar to word-based models in structure and implementation.10\n",
    "\n",
    "An important lesson that you should take away from this example is that implementation and training of an MLP is a straightforward progression from the implementation and training we saw for a perceptron in Chapter 3. In fact, we point back to the example in Chapter 3 throughout the book as the place to go to get a more thorough overview of these components. Further, we will not include code that you can see in “Example: Classifying Sentiment of Restaurant Reviews” If you want to see the example code in one place, we highly encourage you to follow along with the supplementary material.11\n",

Then, we step through the pipeline from a surname string to a vectorized minibatch using the Vocabulary, Vectorizer, and DataLoader classes. If you read through Chapter 3, you should recognize these auxiliary classes as old friends, with some small modifications.\n",

    "We continue the section by describing the surnameclassifier model and the thought process underlying its design. The MLP is similar to the perceptron example we saw in Chapter 3, but in addition to the model change, we introduce multiclass outputs and their corresponding loss functions in this example. After describing the model, we walk through the training routine. This is quite similar to what you saw in “The Training Routine” so for brevity we do not go into as much depth here as we did in that section. We strongly recommend that you refer back that section for additional clarification.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude the example by evaluating the model on the test portion of the dataset and describing the inference procedure on a new surname.

    "In this example, we introduce the surnames dataset, a collection of 10,000 surnames from 18 different nationalities collected by the authors from different name sources on the internet. This dataset will be reused in several examples in the book and has several properties that make it interesting. The first property is that it is fairly imbalanced. The top three classes account for more than 60% of the data: 27% are English, 21% are Russian, and 14% are Arabic. The remaining 15 nationalities have decreasing frequency—a property that is endemic to language, as well. The second property is that there is a valid and intuitive relationship between nationality of origin and surname orthography (spelling). There are spelling variations that are strongly tied to nation of origin (such in “O’Neill,” “Antonopoulos,” “Nagasawa,” or “Zhu”).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the final dataset, we began with a less-processed version than what is included in this book’s supplementary material and performed several dataset modification operations. The first was to reduce the imbalance—the original dataset was more than 70% Russian, perhaps due to a sampling bias or a proliferation in unique Russian surnames. For this, we subsampled this overrepresented class by selecting a randomized subset of surnames labeled as Russian. Next, we grouped the dataset based on nationality and split the dataset into three sections: 70% to a training dataset, 15% to a validation dataset, and the last 15% to the testing dataset, such that the class label distributions are comparable across the splits.\n",

    "The implementation of the SurnameDataset is nearly identical to the ReviewDataset as seen in “Example: Classifying Sentiment of Restaurant Reviews”, with only minor differences in how the __getitem__() method is implemented.12 Recall that the dataset classes presented in this book inherit from PyTorch’s Dataset class, and as such, we need to implement two functions: the __getitem__() method, which returns a data point when given an index; and the __len__() method, which returns the length of the dataset. The difference between the example in Chapter 3 and this example is in the __getitem__ method as shown in Example 4-5. Rather than returning a vectorized review as in “Example: Classifying Sentiment of Restaurant Reviews”, it returns a vectorized surname and the index corresponding to its nationality.\n",

The add_token() method is used to add new tokens into the Vocabulary, the lookup_token() method is used to retrieve an index, and the lookup_index() method is used to retrieve a token given an index (which is useful in the inference stage). In contrast with the Vocabulary for Yelp reviews, we use a one-hot representation13 and do not count the frequency of characters and restrict only to frequent items. This is mainly because the dataset is small and most characters are frequent enough.\n",

    "Whereas the Vocabulary converts individual tokens (characters) to integers, the SurnameVectorizer is responsible for applying the Vocabulary and converting a surname into a vector. The instantiation and use are very similar to the ReviewVectorizer in “Vectorizer”, but with one key difference: the string is not split on whitespace. Surnames are sequences of characters, and each character is an individual token in our Vocabulary. However, until “Convolutional Neural Networks”, we will ignore the sequence information and create a collapsed one-hot vector representation of the input by iterating over each character in the string input. We designate a special token, UNK, for characters not encountered before. The UNK symbol is still used in the character Vocabulary because we instantiate the Vocabulary from the training data only and there could be unique characters in the validation or testing data.14\n",
    "\n",
    "You should note that although we used the collapsed one-hot representation in this example, you will learn about other methods of vectorization in later chapters that are alternatives to, and sometimes better than, the one-hot encoding. Specifically, in “Example: Classifying Surnames by Using a CNN”, you will see a one-hot matrix in which each character is a position in the matrix and has its own one-hot vector. Then, in Chapter 5, you will learn about the embedding layer, the vectorization that returns a vector of integers, and how those are used to create a matrix of dense vectors.

In this example, invoking classifier.eval() prevents PyTorch from updating the model parameters when the test/evaluation data is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model achieves around 50% accuracy on the test data. If you run the training routine in the accompanying notebook, you will notice that the performance on the training data is higher. This is because the model will always fit better to the data on which it is training, so the performance on the training data is not indicative of performance on new data. If you are following along with the code, we encourage you to try different sizes of the hidden dimension. You should notice an increase in performance.16 However, the increase will not be substantial (especially when compared with the model from “Example: Classifying Surnames by Using a CNN”). The primary reason is that the collapsed one-hot vectorization method is a weak representation.

These weight regularization methods also apply to MLPs as well as convolutional neural networks, which we’ll look at in the next section. In addition to weight regularization, for deep models (i.e., models with multiple layers) such as the feed-forward networks discussed in this chapter, a structural regularization approach called dropout becomes very important.\n",

    "\n",
    "Dropout, simply described, is the concept that if you can learn how to do a task repeatedly whilst drunk, you should be able to do the task even better when sober. This insight has resulted in numerous state-of-the-art results and a nascent field dedicated to preventing dropout from being used on neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks—especially deep networks with a large number of layers—can create interesting coadaptation between the units. “Coadaptation” is a term from neuroscience, but here it simply refers to a situation in which the connection between two units becomes excessively strong at the expense of connections between other units. This usually results in the model overfitting to the data. By probabilistically dropping connections between units, we can ensure no single unit will always depend on another single unit, leading to robust models. Dropout does not add additional parameters to the model, but requires a single hyperparameter—the “drop probability.”18 This, as you might have guessed, is the probability with which the connections between units are dropped. It is typical to set the drop probability to 0.5. Example 4-13 presents a reimplementation of the MLP with dropout.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the first part of this chapter, we took an in-depth look at MLPs, neural networks built from a series of linear layers and nonlinear functions. MLPs are not the best tool for taking advantage of sequential patterns.19 For example, in the surnames dataset, surnames can have segments that reveal quite a bit about their nation of origin (such as the “O’” in “O’Neill,” “opoulos” in “Antonopoulos,” “sawa” in “Nagasawa,” or “Zh” in “Zhu”). These segments can be of variable lengths, and the challenge is to capture them without encoding them explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we cover the convolutional neural network, a type of neural network that is well suited to detecting spatial substructure (and creating meaningful spatial substructure as a consequence). CNNs accomplish this by having a small number of weights they use to scan the input data tensors. From this scanning, they produce output tensors that represent the detection (or not) of substructures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we begin by describing the ways in which a CNN can function and the concerns you should have when designing CNNs. We dive deep into the CNN hyperparameters, with the goal of providing intuitions on the behavior and effects of these hyperparameters on the outputs. Finally, we step through a few simple examples that illustrate the mechanics of CNNs. In “Example: Classifying Surnames by Using a CNN”, we delve into a more extensive example.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### HISTORICAL CONTEXT\n",
    "> The name and basic functionality of CNNs stem from a classic mathematical operation called convolution. Convolutions have been used in various engineering disciplines, including digital signal processing and computer graphics, for decades now. Classically, convolutions have used parameters specified by the programmer. The parameters are specified to match some functional design, such as highlighting edges or dampening high-frequency sounds. In fact, many Photoshop filters are fixed-convolution operations applied to an image. However, in deep learning and in this chapter, we learn the parameters of the convolution filter from data so it is optimal for solving the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CNN Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an understanding of what the different design decisions mean to a CNN, we show an example in Figure 4-6. In this example, a single “kernel” is applied to an input matrix. The exact mathematical expression for a convolution operation (a linear operator) is not important for understanding this section; the intuition you should develop from this figure is that a kernel is a small square matrix that is applied at different positions in the input matrix in a systematic way.\n",

    "        <h4 style=\"font-family: courier; font-size: .8em;\">Figure 4-6. A two-dimensional convolution operation. An input matrix is convolved with a single convolutional kernel to produce an output matrix (also called a feature map). The convolving is the application of the kernel to each position in the input matrix. In each application, the kernel multiplies the values of the input matrix with its own values and then sums up these multiplications. In this example, the kernel has the following hyperparameter configuration: kernel_size=2, stride=1, padding=0, and dilation=1. These hyperparameters are explained in the following text.</h4>\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although classic convolutions20 are designed by specifying the values of the kernel,21 CNNs are designed by specifying hyperparameters that control the behavior of the CNN and then using gradient descent to find the best parameters for a given dataset. The two primary hyperparameters control the shape of the convolution (called the kernel_size) and the positions the convolution will multiply in the input data tensor (called the stride). There are additional hyperparameters that control how much the input data tensor is padded with 0s (called padding) and how far apart the multiplications should be when applied to the input data tensor (called dilation). In the following subsections, we develop intuitions for these hyperparameters in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DIMENSION OF THE CONVOLUTION OPERATION\n",
    "\n",
    "The first concept to understand is the dimensionality of the convolution operation. In Figure 4-6 and rest of the figures in this section, we illustrate using a two-dimensional convolution, but there are convolutions of other dimensions that may be more suitable depending on the nature of the data. In PyTorch, convolutions can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional and are implemented by the Conv1d, Conv2d, and Conv3d modules, respectively. The one-dimensional convolutions are useful for time series in which each time step has a feature vector. In this situation, we can learn patterns on the sequence dimension. Most convolution operations in NLP are one-dimensional convolutions. A two-dimensional convolution, on the other hand, tries to capture spatio-temporal patterns along two directions in the data—for example, in images along the height and width dimensions, which is why two-dimensional convolutions are popular for image processing. Similarly, in three-dimensional convolutions the patterns are captured along three dimensions in the data. For example, in video data, information lies in three dimensions (the two dimensions representing the frame of the image, and the time dimension representing the sequence of frames). As far as this book is concerned, we use Conv1d primarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CHANNELS\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, channels refers to the feature dimension along each point in the input. For example, in images there are three channels for each pixel in the image, corresponding to the RGB components. A similar concept can be carried over to text data when using convolutions. Conceptually, if “pixels” in a text document are words, the number of channels is the size of the vocabulary. If we go finer-grained and consider convolution over characters, the number of channels is the size of the character set (which happens to be the vocabulary in this case). In PyTorch’s convolution implementation, the number of channels in the input is the in_channels argument. The convolution operation can produce more than one channel in the output (out_channels). You can consider this as the convolution operator “mapping” the input feature dimension to an output feature dimension. Figures 4-7 and 4-8 illustrate this concept.\n",

To simplify this difficulty, let’s say that the bounds are 1 and 1,024—we can have a convolutional layer with a single channel, up to a maximum of 1,024 channels. Now that we have bounds, the next thing to consider is how many input channels there are. A common design pattern is not to shrink the number of channels by more than a factor of two from one convolutional layer to the next. This is not a hard-and-fast rule, but it should give you some sense of what an appropriate number of out_channels would look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "### KERNEL SIZE\n",
    "\n",
    "The width of the kernel matrix is called the kernel size (kernel_size in PyTorch). In Figure 4-6 the kernel size was 2, and for contrast, we show a kernel with size 3 in Figure 4-9. The intuition you should develop is that convolutions combine spatially (or temporally) local information in the input and the amount of local information per convolution is controlled by the kernel size. However, by increasing the size of the kernel, you also decrease the size of the output (Dumoulin and Visin, 2016). This is why the output matrix is 2×2 in Figure 4-9 when the kernel size is 3, but 3×3 in Figure 4-6 when the kernel size is 2.\n",

    "    </div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can think of the behavior of kernel size in NLP applications as being similar to the behavior of n-grams, which capture patterns in language by looking at groups of words. With smaller kernel sizes, smaller, more frequent patterns are captured, whereas larger kernel sizes lead to larger patterns, which might be more meaningful but occur less frequently. Small kernel sizes lead to fine-grained features in the output, whereas large kernel sizes lead to coarse-grained features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STRIDE\n",
    "\n",
    "Stride controls the step size between convolutions. If the stride is the same size as the kernel, the kernel computations do not overlap. On the other hand, if the stride is 1, the kernels are maximally overlapping. The output tensor can be deliberately shrunk to summarize information by increasing the stride, as demonstrated in Figure 4-10.\n",

    "Even though stride and kernel_size allow for controlling how much scope each computed feature value has, they have a detrimental, and sometimes unintended, side effect of shrinking the total size of the feature map (the output of a convolution). To counteract this, the input data tensor is artificially made larger in length (if 1D, 2D, or 3D), height (if 2D or 3D, and depth (if 3D) by appending and prepending 0s to each respective dimension. This consequently means that the CNN will perform more convolutions, but the output shape can be controlled without compromising the desired kernel size, stride, or dilation. Figure 4-11 illustrates padding in action.\n",

In Figure 4-12 we show that increasing the dilation from 1 (the default) to 2 means that the elements of the kernel are two spaces away from each other when applied to the input matrix. Another way to think about this is striding in the kernel itself—there is a step size between the elements in the kernel or application of kernel with “holes.” This can be useful for summarizing larger regions of the input space without an increase in the number of parameters. Dilated convolutions have proven very useful when convolution layers are stacked. Successive dilated convolutions exponentially increase the size of the “receptive field”; that is, the size of the input space seen by the network before a prediction is made.\n",

    "## Implementing CNNs in PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we work through an end-to-end example that will utilize the concepts introduced in the previous section. Generally, the goal of neural network design is to find a configuration of hyperparameters that will accomplish a task. We again consider the now-familiar surname classification task introduced in “Example: Surname Classification with an MLP”, but we will use CNNs instead of an MLP. We still need to apply a final Linear layer that will learn to create a prediction vector from a feature vector created by a series of convolution layers. This implies that the goal is to determine a configuration of convolution layers that results in the desired feature vector. All CNN applications are like this: there is an initial set of convolutional layers that extract a feature map that becomes input in some upstream processing. In classification, the upstream processing is almost always the application of a Linear (or fc) layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation walk through in this section iterates over the design decisions to construct a feature vector.22 We begin by constructing an artificial data tensor mirroring the actual data in shape. The size of the data tensor is going to be three-dimensional—this is the size of the minibatch of vectorized text data. If you use a one-hot vector for each character in a sequence of characters, a sequence of one-hot vectors is a matrix, and a minibatch of one-hot matrices is a three-dimensional tensor. Using the terminology of convolutions, the size of each one-hot vector (usually the size of the vocabulary) is the number of “input channels” and the length of the character sequence is the “width.”\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated in Example 4-14, the first step to constructing a feature vector is applying an instance of PyTorch’s Conv1d class to the three-dimensional data tensor. By checking the size of the output, you can get a sense of how much the tensor has been reduced. We refer you to Figure 4-9 for a visual explanation of why the output tensor is shrinking."

In general, the process of applying convolutions to reduce the size of the output tensor is iterative and requires some guesswork. Our example is constructed so that after three convolutions, the resulting output has size=1 on the final dimension.23\n",

The final step to the tensor actually being a feature vector is to remove the pesky size=1 dimension. You can do this by using the squeeze() method. This method will drop any dimensions that have size=1 and return the result. The resulting feature vectors can then be used in conjunction with other neural network components, such as a Linear layer, to compute prediction vectors.\n",

    "There are two other methods for reducing a tensor to one feature vector per data point: flattening the remaining values into a feature vector, and averaging24 over the extra dimensions. The two methods are shown in Example 4-16. Using the first method, you just flatten all vectors into a single vector using PyTorch’s view() method.25 The second method uses some mathematical operation to summarize the information in the vectors. The most common operation is the arithmetic mean, but summing and using the max value along the feature map dimensions are also common. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages. Flattening retains all of the information but can result in larger feature vectors than is desirable (or computationally feasible). Averaging becomes agnostic to the size of the extra dimensions but can lose information.26\n",

    "This method for designing a series of convolutions is empirically based: you start with the expected size of your data, play around with the series of convolutions, and eventually get a feature vector that suits you. Although this works well in practice, there is another method of computing the output size of a tensor given the convolution’s hyperparameters and an input tensor, by using a mathematical formula derived from the convolution operation itself.\n",

The input to the model, rather than the collapsed one-hots we saw in the last example, will be a matrix of one-hots. This design will allow the CNN to get a better “view” of the arrangement of characters and encode the sequence information that was lost in the collapsed one-hot encoding used in “Example: Surname Classification with an MLP”.\n",

To accomplish this, we implement a dataset class that tracks the longest surname and provides it to the vectorizer as the number of rows to include in the matrix. The number of columns is the size of the one-hot vectors (the size of the Vocabulary). Example 4-17 shows the change to the SurnameDataset.__getitem__() method we show the change to SurnameVectorizer.vectorize() in the next subsection.\n",

Importantly, each column in the matrix is a different one-hot vector.

As you can see in Example 4-19, there are both similarities to the sequence of Conv1d that we introduced in that section and new additions that require explaining. Specifically, the model is similar to the previous one in that it uses a series of one-dimensional convolutions to compute incrementally more features that result in a single-feature vector.\n",

In this case, we use it to encapsulate the application of the Conv1d sequence. ELU is a nonlinearity similar to the ReLU introduced in Chapter 3, but rather than clipping values below 0, it exponentiates them. ELU has been shown to be a promising nonlinearity to use between convolutional layers (Clevert et al., 2015).\n",

    "## The Training Routine\n",
    "\n",
    "Training routines consist of the following now-familiar sequence of operations: instantiate the dataset, instantiate the model, instantiate the loss function, instantiate the optimizer, iterate over the dataset’s training partition and update the model parameters, iterate over the dataset’s validation partition and measure the performance, and then repeat the dataset iterations a certain number of times. This is the third training routine implementation in the book so far, and this sequence of operations should be internalized. We will not describe the specific training routine in any more detail for this example because it is the exact same routine from “Example: Surname Classification with an MLP”. The input arguments, however, are different, which you can see in Example 4-20.\n",

    "\n",
    "To understand the model’s performance, you need quantitative and qualitative measures of performance. The basic components for these two measures are described next. We encourage you to expand upon them to explore the model and what it has learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### EVALUATING ON THE TEST DATASET\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as the training routine did not change between the previous example and this one, the code performing the evaluation has not changed either. To summarize, the classifier’s eval() method is invoked to prevent backpropagation, and the test dataset is iterated over. The test set performance of this model is around 56% accurate as compared to the approximate 50% accuracy of the MLP. Although these performance numbers are not by any means upper bounds for these specific architectures, the improvement obtained by a relatively simple CNN model should be convincing enough to encourage you to try out CNNs on textual data.\n",

The same change is reflected in the predict_topk_nationality() function.\n",

    "\n",
    "To conclude our discussion, in this section we outline a few additional topics that are central to CNNs but have a primary role in their common use. In particular, you will see descriptions of pooling operations, batch normalization, network-in-network connections, and residual connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling is an operation to summarize a higher-dimensional feature map to a lower-dimensional feature map. The output of a convolution is a feature map. The values in the feature map summarize some region of the input. Due to the overlapping nature of convolution computation, many of the computed features can be redundant. Pooling is a way to summarize a high-dimensional, and possibly redundant, feature map into a lower-dimensional one. Formally, pooling is an arithmetic operator like sum, mean, or max applied over a local region in a feature map in a systematic way, and the resulting pooling operations are known as sum pooling, average pooling, and max pooling, respectively. Pooling can also function as a way to improve the statistical strength of a larger but weaker feature map into a smaller but stronger feature map. Figure 4-13 illustrates pooling.\n",

    "        <h4 style=\"font-family: courier; font-size: .8em;\">Figure 4-13. The pooling operation as shown here is functionally identical to a convolution: it is applied to different positions in the input matrix. However, rather than multiply and sum the values of the input matrix, the pooling operation applies some function G that pools the values. G can be any operation, but summing, finding the max, and computing the average are the most common.</h4>\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Batch Normalization (BatchNorm)\n",
    "Batch normalization, or BatchNorm, is an often-used tool in designing CNNs. BatchNorm applies a transformation to the output of a CNN by scaling the activations to have zero mean and unit variance. The mean and variance values it uses for the Z-transform29 are updated per batch such that fluctuations in any single batch won’t shift or affect it too much. BatchNorm allows models to be less sensitive to initialization of the parameters and simplifies the tuning of learning rates (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015). In PyTorch, BatchNorm is defined in the nn module. Example 4-22 shows how to instantiate and use BatchNorm with convolution and Linear layers.\n",

    "## Network-in-Network Connections (1x1 Convolutions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Network-in-network (NiN) connections are convolutional kernels with kernel_size=1 and have a few interesting properties. In particular, a 1×1 convolution acts like a fully connected linear layer across the channels.30 This is useful in mapping from feature maps with many channels to shallower feature maps. In Figure 4-14, we show a single NiN connection being applied to an input matrix. As you can see, it reduces the two channels down to a single channel. Thus, NiN or 1×1 convolutions provide an inexpensive way to incorporate additional nonlinearity with few parameters (Lin et al., 2013).\n",

    "Figure 4-14. An example of a 1×1 convolution operation in action. Observe how the 1×1 convolution operation reduces the number of channels from two to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Residual Connections/Residual Block\n",
    "One of the most significant trends in CNNs that has enabled really deep networks (more than 100 layers) is the residual connection. It is also called a skip connection. If we let the convolution function be represented as conv, the output of a residual block is as follows:31\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "output = conv ( input ) + input\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an implicit trick to this operation, however, which we show in Figure 4-15. For the input to be added to the output of the convolution, they must have the same shape. To accomplish this, the standard practice is to apply a padding before convolution. In Figure 4-15, the padding is of size 1 for a convolution of size 3. To learn more about the details of residual connections, the original paper by He et al. (2016) is still a great reference. For an example of residual networks used in NLP, see Huang and Wang (2017).\n",

This is described visually above as the convolutional layer is applied to the input matrix and the resultant added to the input matrix. A common hyper parameter setting to create outputs that are the size as the inputs is let kernel_size=3 and padding=1. In general, any odd kernel_size with padding=(floor(kernel_size)/2 - 1) will result in an output that is the same size as its input. See Figure 4-11 for a visual explanation of padding and convolutions. The matrix resulting from the convolutional layer is added to the input and the final resultant is the output of the residual connection computation. (The figure inspired by Figure 2 in He et al.

    "# Summary\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned two basic feed-forward architectures: the multilayer perceptron (MLP; also called “fully-connected” network) and the convolutional neural network (CNN). We saw the power of MLPs in approximating any nonlinear function and showed applications of MLPs in NLP with the application of classifying nationalities from surnames. We studied one of the major disadvantages/limitations of MLPs—lack of parameter sharing—and introduced the convolutional network architecture as a possible solution. CNNs, originally developed for computer vision, have become a mainstay in NLP; primarily because of their highly efficient implementation and low memory requirements. We studied different variants of convolutions—padded, dilated, and strided—and how they transform the input space. This chapter also dedicated a nontrivial length of discussion on the practical matter of choosing input and output sizes for the convolutional filters. We showed how the convolution operation helps capture substructure information in language by extending the surname classification example to use convnets. Finally, we discussed some miscellaneous, but important, topics related to convolutional network design: 1) Pooling, 2) BatchNorm, 3) 1x1 convolutions, and 4) residual connections. In modern CNN design, it is common to see many of these tricks employed at once as seen in the Inception architecture (Szegedy et al., 2015) in which a mindful use of these tricks led convolutional networks hundreds of layers deep that were not only accurate but fast to train. In the Chapter 5, we explore the topic of learning and using representations for discrete units, like words, sentences, documents, and other feature types using Embeddings.\n",

    "1. A “feed-forward” network is any neural network in which the data flows in one direction (i.e., from input to output). By this definition, the perceptron is also a “feed-forward” model, but usually the term is reserved for more complicated models with multiple units.\n",
    "2. In PyTorch terminology, this is a tensor. Remember that a vector is a special case of a tensor. In this chapter, and rest of this book, we use “vector” and tensor interchangeably when it makes sense.\n",
    "3. This is common practice in deep learning literature. If there is more than one fully connected layer, they are numbered from left to right as fc-1, fc-2, and so on.\n",
    "4. This is easy to prove if you write down the equations of a Linear layer. We invite you to do this as an exercise.\n",
    "5. Sometimes also called a “representation vector.”\n",
    "6. There is a coordination between model outputs and loss functions in PyTorch. The documentation goes into more detail on this; for example, it states which loss functions expect a pre-softmax prediction vector and which don’t. The exact reasons are based upon mathematical simplifications and numerical stability.\n",
    "7. This is actually a very significant point. A deeper investigation of these concepts is beyond the scope of this book, but we invite you to work through Frank Ferraro and Jason Eisner’s tutorial on the topic.\n",
    "8. While we acknowledge this point, we do not go into all of the interactions between output nonlinearity and loss functions. The PyTorch documentation makes it clear and should be the place you consult for details on such matters.\n",

    "15. We intentionally put probabilities in quotation marks just to emphasize that these are not true posterior probabilities in a Bayesian sense, but since the output sums to 1 it is a valid distribution and hence can be interpreted as probabilities. This is also one of the most pedantic footnotes in this book, so feel free to ignore this, close your eyes, hold your nose, and call them probabilities.\n",
    "16. Reminder from Chapter 3: when experimenting with hyperparameters, such as the size of the hidden dimension, and number of layers, the choices should be evaluated on the validation set and not the test set. When you’re happy with the set of hyperparameters, you can run the evaluation on the test data.\n",
    "17. This definition comes from Stephen’s April Fool’s “paper,” which is a highly entertaining read.\n",
    "18. Some deep learning libraries confusingly refer to (and interpret) this probability as “keep probability,” with the opposite meaning of a drop probability.\n",
    "19. It is possible to design an MLP that takes as input character bigrams to capture some of these dependencies. For the 26 characters in English, the number of character bigrams is 325. So, if we have a hidden layer of 100 nodes, the number of parameters for the input-hidden layer will be 325 * 100. If we also consider all possible character trigrams, that will be an additional 2,600 * 100 parameters. CNNs efficiently capture the same information with far fewer parameters, as we will see, using parameter sharing.\n",
    "20. See the box “Historical Context” for more information about classic convolutions.\n",
    "21. Many filters in image-editing programs such as Photoshop operate by doing this. For example, you can highlight edges using a convolutional filter specifically designed for that purpose.\n",
    "22. Most deep learning books skip this detail and just present the end network as if it came from divine providence. We think this section should walk an unfamiliar reader through the process of how a certain convolutional network is arrived at, starting from the input. In most situations, especially when you are implementing an existing paper, you don’t need to do this. You can simply use the values supplied by the authors.\n",
    "23. For larger tensors, you will need more convolutions. You’ll also need to modify the convolutions to reduce the tensor at a faster rate. The hyperparameters to try out are increasing stride, increasing dilation, and increasing the kernel_size.\n",
    "24. In actuality, you can also compute the sum or use an attention-based mechanism, as described in Chapter 8. For simplicity, we discuss only these two methods.\n",
    "25. For more details on the view() method, refer to Chapter 1.\n",
    "26. Additionally, careful bookkeeping is needed for variable-length sequences, which are introduced in Chapter 6. In short, some positions may be all 0s to allow for sequences of different length. In this situation, while averaging, you would sum over the extra dimensions and divide by the number of nonzero entries.\n",
